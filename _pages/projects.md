**Anti-corruption policies on the municipal politics**  
Ongoing. _CEPESP - FGV_, post-doctoral.  
Although experts recommend the adoption of independent anti-corruption institutions, we still do not know what such authority delegated to unelected agents could entail for electoral competition. The aim of this project is to test the impact of anti-corruption actions by independent institutions on the stability of the party system. The main hypothesis is that the absence of the opposition in leading anti-corruption actions would drive voters to choose outsiders and small parties. With data from the municipal audits carried out by the Federal Comptroller Body (CGU) and on the candidates convicted by the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE), the hypothesis will be tested with methods of natural experiment and instrumental variable. The results may provide relevant implications for the discussion about the impact of anti-corruption actions on municipal politics.  
  
**When independent courts remove corrupt politicians from elections**  
Ongoing. _Social Science Research Council’s Democratic Anxieties in the Americas Research Grants_.  
After the approval of the Clean Record Law in 2010, the Supreme Electoral Court (“Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, TSE”) has acquired a role of forbidding corrupt politicians to run elections for 8 years. The main goal of this project is to answer whether independent courts contribute to improving the performance of governments in providing public policies when judges put corrupt politicians away from the electoral campaign. The results show that municipalities with corrupt former mayors removed from elections provide greater health care than other local governments.
