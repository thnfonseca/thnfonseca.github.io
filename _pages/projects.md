**Compliance Trade-offs: Bans on Corporate Money and Public-Job Patronage**  
Ongoing. _IDB Research Network_.  
This study investigates whether the 2015 prohibition of corporate campaign donations in Brazil unintentionally increased the use of public-sector jobs as a substitute for electoral exchange. Using a differences-in-discontinuities (DiDisc) design that combines close-election regression discontinuity with the exogenous 2015 policy reform, the project tests whether mayors became more likely to hire donors and service providers after the ban on corporate money. Additionally, it examines if the presence of independent anti-corruption prosecutors moderates this effect by constraining patronage hiring. The findings aim to highlight how anti-corruption reforms may lead to the evolution of illicit exchanges into new forms when not accompanied by strong oversight mechanisms.  

**Anti-corruption policies on the municipal politics**  
Ongoing. _CEPESP - FGV_, post-doctoral.  
Although experts recommend the adoption of independent anti-corruption institutions, we still do not know what such authority delegated to unelected agents could entail for electoral competition. The aim of this project is to test the impact of anti-corruption actions by independent institutions on the stability of the party system. With data from the municipal audits carried out by the Federal Comptroller Body (CGU) and on the candidates convicted by the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE), the main hypotheses will be tested with natural experiment and instrumental variable methods. The results may provide relevant implications for the discussion about the impact of anti-corruption actions on municipal politics.  
  
**When independent courts remove corrupt politicians from elections**  
 _2021. _Social Science Research Council’s Democratic Anxieties in the Americas Research Grants_.  
After the approval of the Clean Record Law in 2010, the Supreme Electoral Court (“Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, TSE”) has acquired a role of forbidding corrupt politicians to run elections for 8 years. The main goal of this project is to answer whether independent courts contribute to improving the performance of governments in providing public policies when judges put corrupt politicians away from the electoral campaign. The results show that municipalities with corrupt former mayors removed from elections provide greater health care than other local governments.
